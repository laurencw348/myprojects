    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>I offer students rigorous and rewarding private tutoring for various IB and IGCSE subjects. I provide efficient and effective solutions to student's weakpoints and ensure that they succeed and excel in their final examinations.Each class will be conducted through either the Zoom platform of through Skype, whichever the student is more comfortable with. We will make use of a whiteboard, online sketchpads and excel documents, Quizlet and other online learning tools.</p>

    <p>All IB subjects offered are subjects that I studied and sat the IB exams for in 2018. I create personalised lesson plans for each student that are specific to the syllabus, accounting for any and all syllabus changes. My students also receive comprehensive notes and important resources, such as past papers and definition lists.</p>
