          <h2>General Information</h2>
          <p>Although I have an Australian passport, I was born and (mostly) raised in the city of <em>Hong Kong</em>- the place I call home. I did live in Australia briefly for about 5 years before moving back to Hong Kong when I was 11 years old. For high school, I decided to upend my life and go to boarding school in Singapore. Although it was daunting to leave my parents and be on my own for the first time, it was the best decision I ever made. I met amazing people and had incredible experiences all in the beautiful city of Singapore.</p>

In my free time, I making and editing short films with my friends. I also love acting: during my high school, I participated in several productions that were both rewarding and exciting.</p>
