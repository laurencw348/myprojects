        <h2>Teaching History</h2>
        <p>Throughout my high school and university, I have engaged in teaching and mentorship. While studying for my IGCSE and IB, I was involved in a volunteer program for children at a daycare center where I helped students with homework and reading. At university, I currently tutor several students in the age range of 6-17 in IB subjects and the German language.</p>
